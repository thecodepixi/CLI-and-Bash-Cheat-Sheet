**Flatiron School Notes** 

This repo contains .md files of notes taken for/from Flatiron School lessons and provided resources. 

Lots of these will be personal cheat sheets for CLI/Bash, Ruby, and JavaScript. 

Probably will update this on a semi-regular basis as I build up decent cheat sheets or sets of notes. 

Feel free to use for your own study purposes. 

Any resources, including Flatiron School lessons and additional articles will be linked at the top of each file.
